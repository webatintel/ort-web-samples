This is a website to collect WebAI demos developed by creative developers around the world. Actually without tremendous great efforts from projects like ONNX Runtime, Transformers.js, TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe, TVM and so on, we couldn't be here with so many great demos.

Especially we want to thank Joshua Lochner, author of Transformers.js, for his full permission to freely use his images, videos and demos related to Transformers.js project.
